# SOLID Principles: An Introduction

SOLID principles are a set of design principles that help developers create maintainable and scalable software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob) in the early 2000s and have since become a cornerstone of modern software development.

The five SOLID principles are:
- [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](./S/README.md)
- [Open-Closed Principle (OCP)](./O/README.md)
- [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](./L/README.md)
- [Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](./I/README.md)
- [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](./D/README.md)

Each principle addresses a specific aspect of software design and when applied correctly, can lead to more robust and flexible code.
